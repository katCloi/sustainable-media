# Summary 
In New Jersey, there are several towns and municipalities that have several problems regarding sustainability. These problems could possibly include pollution, water scarcity, energy, food production, and other environmental problems. Although most people in a particular town may be aware of their sustainable issues, others in Jersey would not be. If other people in New Jersey are not aware of the problems affecting their communities, then it’s impossible for those problems to be solved. If more people knew about their sustainable issues, then it’s possible that a solution could be provided.

The objective of the module is to bring awareness to sustainable issues in New Jersey communities. Our web application should be able to help users have a means of voicing out local sustainability issues while also giving journalists a platform to write about these issues. Members of New Jersey communities and journalists will both benefit from our website because it will give them both a voice and possibly help provide a solution for their local problems.
